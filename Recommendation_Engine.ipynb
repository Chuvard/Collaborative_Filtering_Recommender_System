    "In this lab, we will implement the collaborative filtering learning algorithm and apply it to a dataset of movie ratings.\n",
    "The goal of a collaborative filtering recommender system is to generate two vectors: For each user, a `parameter vector` that embodies the movie tastes of a user. For each movie, a feature vector of the same size which embodies some description of the movie. The dot product of the two vectors plus the bias term should produce an estimate of the rating the user might give to that movie.\n",

    "Existing ratings are provided in matrix form as shown. $Y$ contains ratings; 0.5 to 5 inclusive in 0.5 steps. 0 if the movie has not been rated. $R$ has a 1 where movies have been rated. Movies are in rows, users in columns. Each user has a parameter vector $w^{user}$ and bias. Each movie has a feature vector $x^{movie}$. These vectors are simultaneously learned by using the existing user/movie ratings as training data. One training example is shown above: $\\mathbf{w}^{(1)} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}^{(1)} + b^{(1)} = 4$. It is worth noting that the feature vector $x^{movie}$ must satisfy all the users while the user vector $w^{user}$ must satisfy all the movies. This is the source of the name of this approach - all the users collaborate to generate the rating set. \n",
