# Collaborative_Filtering_Recommender_System


### Project's Title: Collaborative Filtering Recommender System


### Project Description (Problem Statement): 
- We will implement the collaborative filtering learning algorithm and apply it to a dataset of movie ratings.

- The goal of a collaborative filtering recommender system is to generate two vectors:
    * For each user, a `parameter vector` that embodies the movie tastes of a user.
    * For each movie, a feature vector of the same size embodies some description of the movie. The dot product of the two vectors plus the bias term should produce an estimate of the rating the user might give to that movie.

### How to Install and Run the Project:

To successfully run this project you have to do the following steps:

	Step 1. Run the "Recommendation_Engine" Jupyter Notebook file on your PC/Notebook.

	Step 2. Import all required libraries and data frames from the Section "Importing modules".

	Step 3. Import the dataset. Run the cell of the "Movie ratings dataset" Section for the corresponding part of a project to get the previously mentioned project goals due to the Collaborative Filtering Recommender System model execution.

	Step 4. Run each cell with Python code within the Jupyter Notebook file sequentially following the instructions. Moreover, get familiar with a theoretical background and comprehensive interpretations of the employed Machine Learning Model to execute the goals of the underlying problem statement.
